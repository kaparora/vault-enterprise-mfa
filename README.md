This is a bunch of numbered shell scripts to demo the Vault MFA enterprise funtionality.

In this demo we use TOTP based MFA with basic userpass authentication.

Run scripts 01-08 to run through the demo
use Script 09 to destroy

The step 05 will generate a qr.png (QR code) file which can be used to configure OTP in e.g. Google authenticator
